this app is a simple dating/friends app in Django>=1.8 for reddit users. see it live at http://redddate.com where you will need a reddit account to sign in.

what it does
------------

the site matches redditors according to the subreddits they belong to. additionally, users can be filtered by geolocation and gender.

but the main idea is matching people anonymously by the subreddits they are active in. the post history gives a good idea about how a person thinks and acts in an anonymous emvironment.

redditors can sign up with their reddit account, if it meets some minimum requirements of account age and karma points.
