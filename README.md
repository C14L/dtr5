A simple meetup/dating app for users of Reddit, Imgur, and other ANONYMOUS
social networks.

See it live: https://reddmeet.com (you need a reddit account to sign in)

##What it does

The site matches redditors according to the subreddits they belong to. 
Additionally, users can be filtered by location, gender, etc.

However, the main idea is to *match people anonymously by the subreddits 
they are active in*. The post history gives a good idea about how a person 
thinks and acts in an anonymous environment.

Redditors can quickly and anonymously sign up with their reddit account.
