<p>Privacy Policy</p>

</div><div class="abouts">

<p>Privacy and anonymity are important on Reddit, and here too. After signup with your reddit account (oAuth), the app only fetches your public user account data and subreddit list. Then, you manually add picture, age, gender, and geolocation coordinates.</p>

<p><u>Geolocation data:</u> the browser fetches your coordinates and fuzzies them by anywhere between 0 and 2 kilometers, before they are uploaded, so your exact location is never known. You can also type in your latitude and longitude manually.</p>

<p><u>Date of birth:</u> its never shown, its only used to show your age and your western and eastern zodiacs on your profile. Punch in your correct date of birth to get your correct zodiacs and age.</p>

<p><u>Trackable data:</u> Your web browser automatically sends some data with every request, such as time, your IP adress, browser User Agent string etc. We don't use any of this data in the app itself. However, it is automatically stored in the web server log files, and may be used to auto-generate traffic statistics. For general traffic stats, the site uses Google Analytics. If you don't want to be part of our traffic stats, you can <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/Policy/Privacy/ga.html">easily block Google Analytics on your computer</a>.</p>

<p><u>Third party CDNs:</u> The site downloads some CSS and fonts from "cdnjs.cloudflare.com", "fonts.googleapis.com", and "maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com" to make page load faster. These services may also keep log files or process your connection data.</p>

<p><u>Google Analytics:</u> This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your anonymised IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Googleâ€™s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

<p><u>Javascript:</u> The site uses some Javascript to make stuff look nicer, but its completely usable with Javascript disabled.</p>

<p><u>Cookies:</u> The site uses a cooky called "sessionid" to keep track of your session and remember if or not you are logged in. Other than that, there is only the Google Analytics cookies.</p>

<p><u>LocalStorage:</u> Not used at the moment.</p>
