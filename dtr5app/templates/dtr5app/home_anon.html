<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lightbulb/">/r/lightbulb</a>, user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TeaStainsAndTobacco">/u/TeaStainsAndTobacco</a> had a cool idea: <strong>"A Reddit dating site that matches you based on interest in similar subreddits."</strong></p>

<p>So, here it is. <a href="{{auth_url}}"><b>Sign up</b></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redddate/">tell me</a> what you think.</p>

<p>Privacy and anonymity are important on Reddit, and here too. After signup with your reddit account (oAuth), the app only fetches your public user account data and subreddit list. Then, you manually add picture, age, gender, and geolocation coordinates.</p>

<p><u>Geolocation data:</u> the browser fetches your coordinates and fuzzies them by anywhere between 0 and 2 kilometers, before they are uploaded, so your exact location is never known. You can also type in your latitude and longitude manually.</p>

<p><u>Date of birth:</u> its never shown, its only used to show your age and your western and eastern zodiacs on your profile. Punch in your correct date of birth to get your correct zodiacs and age.</p>
